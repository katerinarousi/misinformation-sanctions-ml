    "# Social Media Sanctions and Misinformation Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a lot of discussions on politics and sanctions in social media. Specifically, people with conservative beliefs argue that they are more likely to be sanctioned on social media than those with more liberal beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this happens, however, that may not necessarily be the result of different policies on behalf of the social media companies. It may simply be that people with conservative beliefs post online more questionable content, and so they are more likely to be sanctioned even with a completely neutral sanction policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [recent analysis in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07942-8), Mohshen Moshel et al. investigated whether social media sanctions are politically biased or they are the result of differences in misinformation sharing between people of different political beliefs. The authors argue that that media sanctions are not politically biased. Social media users with conservative political beliefs are more likely to post questionable or misinformation material, and so they are more likely to be sanctioned. In this assignment, you will follow through some of Moshel et al.'s research.\n",
